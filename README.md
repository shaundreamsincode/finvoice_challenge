To run this project, type `bin/dev` in a terminal.

A few things to note:

- I wasn't able to get Jest installed in my project because my internet connection kept timing out when I tried to install it with `yarn`! :( I am happy to talk about how I would test it though if that would make sense? Otherwise, I have extensive controller and model specs in the backend.

- The one thing I would have worked on if I had more time (I didn't want to spend forever on this) was styling the frontend. Specifically, the modal. You'll see that it's a bit ugly but the functionality still works!
